# Overview

I see a great need in the ability to create mobile apps throughout a career. I created this program in hopes that it would give me a strong foundation to build on and be able to learn more from here.

To use the app, you must enter a value in either Quetzales or Dollars. You can then push the correct button to convert the value into the other currency. The reset button will clear the input and output values.
